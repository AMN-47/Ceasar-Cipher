# Ceasar-Cipher 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic understanding on how to use functions in Python. 

I have learnt and applied the following concepts when building this caesar cipher:
1. the purpose of the isinstance module and how to use it.
2. how to call functions within another function.
3. using if statements and loops for error handeling.
